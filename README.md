🧬 EggNOG Functional Pipeline
This is a suite of automated tools for the functional interpretation and visualization of genomic annotations generated by eggNOG-mapper. The pipeline transforms complex .xlsx spreadsheets into high-quality Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).

🚀 Features
Modern Interface: A graphical user interface (GUI) built with CustomTkinter for easy file selection and customization.

AI-Powered Color Extraction: Upload a reference image to automatically extract a balanced palette of 11 colors using the K-Means clustering algorithm.

Automatic Data Cleaning: The pipeline automatically detects and removes metadata or comment lines (starting with #) often found in cluster outputs, ensuring the data is processed correctly without manual editing.

Bioinformatics Pipeline:

COG Category: Generates a Sunburst chart showing the macro and functional hierarchy of COG groups.

Gene Ontology (GO): Categorizes and counts GO terms across Biological Process, Cellular Component, and Molecular Function.

KEGG Pathway: Maps KO identifiers directly from the KEGG API to visualize the most abundant metabolic levels.

🛠️ Prerequisites
Instead of installing libraries one by one, you can use the requirements.txt file provided in this repository.

Install all dependencies:

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: The Gene Ontology script requires the go.obo file in the root directory to function correctly.

📖 How to Use
Run the main script:

Bash
python interface.py
Click "Choose .xlsx Spreadsheet" and select your eggNOG-mapper output.

(Optional) Use the "Extract Colors from Image" button to define the visual identity of your charts based on any photo.

Click "Run Pipeline", and the .svg files will be generated in the project folder.
