🧬 EggNOG Functional Pipeline
This is a suite of automated tools for the functional interpretation and visualization of genomic annotations generated by eggNOG-mapper. The pipeline transforms complex .xlsx spreadsheets into high-quality Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).

🚀 Features
Modern Interface: A graphical user interface (GUI) built with CustomTkinter for easy file selection and customization.

AI-Powered Color Extraction: Upload a reference image to automatically extract a balanced palette of 11 colors using the K-Means clustering algorithm.

Bioinformatics Pipeline:

COG Category: Generates a Sunburst chart showing the macro and functional hierarchy of COG groups.

Gene Ontology (GO): Categorizes and counts GO terms across Biological Process, Cellular Component, and Molecular Function.

KEGG Pathway: Maps KO identifiers directly from the KEGG API to visualize the most abundant metabolic levels.

⚠️ Attention: Spreadsheet Formatting (Important)
To ensure the program identifies your data correctly, the Excel spreadsheet must follow these rules:

Headers on Row 1: Column names (e.g., COG_category, GOs, KEGG_ko) must be located on the very first row of the spreadsheet.

Cleaning Cluster Output Files: Files originating from clusters or servers often contain metadata lines or comments at the top (starting with #). You must delete these extra lines before running the program to ensure the header is on Row 1 of the .xlsx file.

🛠️ Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed (you can copy and paste the command below into your terminal):

Bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib plotly requests openpyxl customtkinter Pillow scikit-learn goatools
Note: The Gene Ontology script requires the go.obo file in the root directory to function correctly.

📖 How to Use
Run the main script:

Bash
python interface.py
Click "Choose .xlsx Spreadsheet" and select the file generated by eggNOG-mapper (ensuring the header is on Row 1).

(Optional) Use the "Extract Colors from Image" button to define the visual identity of your charts.

Click "Run Pipeline", and the .svg files will be generated in the project folder.
